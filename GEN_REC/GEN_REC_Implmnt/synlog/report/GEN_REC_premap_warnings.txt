@W: MT529 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\shiftreg_earendel\fsm_shiftregs.v":46:4:46:9|Found inferred clock fsm|CLK which controls 12 sequential elements including current_state[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
