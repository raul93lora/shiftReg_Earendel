@W: MT529 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\shiftreg_earendeltest\fsm_ctrl.v":119:1:119:6|Found inferred clock top|CLK_fast which controls 2 sequential elements including fsm_ctrl_inst1.CLK_uC_1. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
